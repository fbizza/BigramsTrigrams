# BigramsTrigrams
Midterm assignment for Parallel Programming university course. This code computes histograms of n-grams on texts in a sequential and parallel way. There are two classes, one for computing word ngrams and one for character ngrams. There is also a function to clean the input text (i.e. remove punctuation) and a function to print the most common ngrmas of the computed histogram.
